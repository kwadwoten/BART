# BART
The PÃ¸rch's Bar of Light (BART) is an audio-visual sign that was designed, built, and programmed by Trenton Rhodes and Kwadwo Tenkorang. See the story of how BART came to be [here](https://wordpress.its.virginia.edu/TLP_TLC/2020/12/01/bart/).

# Usage
The working version of BART is in `BART_v1.2`. Simply plug in BART to turn it on. It will start in Wahoo mode. Clicking the button under BART will cycle through the following modes:
1. Wahoo - Solid navy blue and orange GO HOOS!
2. Wahoo Party - Wahoo colors that react to music. Brightness will match music loudness. Top lights up to treble, bottom to bass.
3. Rainbow Road - Rainbow colors with a sparkle, reminiscent of the countless hours of Mario Kart we played
4. Off - All lights turn off
